This is my first problem statement solved using Java Programming. This is the problem statement:
A Taxi driver charges the following fares for his cab.
1. For the first 5km - Rs.100 fixed rate.
2. For the next 10 kms - Rs.10/km
3. For the next 10 kms after 15 kms - Rs.8/km
4. For above 25kms - Rs.5/km
I coded a simple fare calculator by using the scanner method to take the input from the user and then using the information to find out the fare to be paid.
Feel free to use the code for reference.
